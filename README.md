# iNOU

This project presents a simple implementation of **face detection and face recognition** in **Streamlit**.

For **face detection**, the system uses the **OpenCV** library, specifically the `CascadeClassifier` with a frontal face Haar cascade.  
For **face recognition**, the project uses **InceptionResNetV1** pretrained on the **VGGFace2** dataset, provided by the `facenet-pytorch` repository.

The project is strictly focused on **engineering aspects and building an intelligent system for real-life applications**, rather than on training, modeling, or benchmarking AI algorithms. The main goal is to demonstrate how these algorithims can be integrated into a practical, interactive application.
